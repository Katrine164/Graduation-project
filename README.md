# Graduation-project

## Project Overview
This graduation project focuses on analyzing customer sentiment from online restaurant reviews scraped from the Talabat platform. The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights about customer satisfaction by combining textual sentiment analysis with numerical ratings.

The reviews were preprocessed using Python, including text cleaning, translation to a unified language, stopwords removal, and sentiment scoring. The processed data was then analyzed and visualized using Power BI to track sentiment trends, detect positive and negative patterns, and support data-driven decision-making for restaurants.
